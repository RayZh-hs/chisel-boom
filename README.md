# Chisel Boom

This repository implements an out-of-order processor inspired by the Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM) using Chisel. It is a simplified version of the extensive BOOM project.

While it is not intended for production use, it aims to match real hardware designs and take realistic hardware constraints and trade-offs into account.
